# LVC_cheat_sheet_day1
This repository contains the cheat sheet for the Day 1 session of Git-Learning Version Control. Fork it and you are good to go ðŸ’» !


# What is version control?
	- Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
	
	- Software teams that do not use any form of version control often run into problems like not knowing which changes that have been made are available to users.

## Benefits of using Version Control Systems

	- A complete long-term change history of every file.This means every change made by many individuals over the years. They also include the author, date and written notes on the purpose of each change.
	
	- Branching and merging. Having team members work concurrently is a no-brainer, but even individuals working on their own can benefit from the ability to work on independent streams of changes.
	
	- And many other different features!

# Installation

## Install Git for Windows 

Just go to https://git-scm.com/download/win and the download will start automatically. Apply the steps described in the session to install.

## Install Git on Linux:
**For Fedora (or any closely-related RPM-based distribution, such as RHEL or CentOS)** 

`sudo dnf install git-all`


**For a Debian-based distribution, such as Ubuntu**

`sudo apt install git-all`


*For other options, there are instructions for installing on several different Unix distributions on the Git website, at https://git-scm.com/download/linux.*

## Install on Mac

A macOS Git installer is maintained and available for download at the Git website, at https://git-scm.com/download/mac. Follow the steps mentioned ont the website after that.


# Seting up the git terminal

GitHub offers a convenient SSH key feature for accessing your repositories on the command line. Instead of using usernames and passwords every time you push to or pull from your repository, you can use your key. In this article weâ€™ll learn how to add SSH keys to your GitHub account.

**REMEMBER** From August 13, 2021, GitHub is no longer accepting account passwords when authenticating Git operations. So this step is no longer optional but compulsory as this is the only way to perform `push`, `merge` or other crucial commands from the user terminal.



1. Create a new SSH: Type `ssh-keygen -t -b 4096 -C "<your email here>"` in your terminal, then press enter.

2. It will ask for a new passphrase. Enter and then confirm a new passphrase.

3. Without changing the path of your terminal, type `eval $(ssh-agent -s)` and press enter.

4. Next, type `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`, and press enter.

5. Go to the present file location manually using File manager and copy the file named `id_rsa.pub`, or you can also type `clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`, if you have windows installed.

6. Go to github.com and login to your account.

7. Go to `settings>SSH and GPG keys`

8. Click on `NEW SSH KEY`

9. Choose a Title and paste the SSH key in the Box.

10. You are all set up!



# Github Commands
See where Git is located:
`which git`

Get the version of Git:
`git --version`

Create an alias (shortcut) for `git status`:
`git config --global alias.st status`

Help:
`git help`

### Initializing the repository
Initialize Git:
`git init`

Get everything ready to commit:
`git add .`

Get custom file ready to commit:
`git add index.html`

### Pull 

Pull:
`git pull`

Pull specific branch:
`git pull origin branchname`

### Commiting
Commit changes:
`git commit -m "Message"`

Commit changes with title and description:
`git commit -m "Title" -m "Description..."`

Add and commit in one step:
`git commit -am "Message"`

### Removing files

Remove files from Git:
`git rm index.html`

Update all changes:
`git add -u`

Remove file but do not track anymore:
`git rm --cached index.html`


### Branching
Show branches:
`git branch`

Create branch:
`git branch branchname`

Change to branch:
`git checkout branchname`

Create and change to new branch:
`git checkout -b branchname`


### Cloning a repository

Clone to localhost:
`git clone https://github.com/user/project.git` or:
`git clone ssh://user@domain.com/~/dir/.git`

Clone to localhost folder:
`git clone https://github.com/user/project.git ~/dir/folder`



### Push 

Push (set default with `-u`):
`git push -u origin master`

Push:
`git push origin master`

Force-Push:
`git push origin master --force


## Terminal Commands

Show folder content: `ls -la`

Show the path to the present working dirctory: `pwd`

Create directory: `mkdir <file_name>`

Change directory: `cd <file_name/file_location>`
